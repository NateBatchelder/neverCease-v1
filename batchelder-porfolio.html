            <h2>'Never Cease'</h2>
            <p>The expression is shorthand for a family saying of mine which says that "those who dare to teach, must never cease to learn.  From an early age I remember seeing these words on an award that my grandfather had as a paperweight.  For me, these words ring the truest when I myself am reaching beyond what I am comfortable and striving to better myself.  Having spent the past 13 years teaching in Title 1 school districts, I have benefited from the opertunities to continue my education both through formal classes and colaboration with students, faculty, and community stakeholders.
